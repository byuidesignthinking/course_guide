> But the test was developed in the 1940s based on the totally untested theories of Carl Jung and is now thoroughly disregarded by the psychology community. [Vox.com](https://www.vox.com/2014/7/15/5881947/myers-briggs-personality-test-meaningless)

> This isn't a test designed to accurately categorize people, but rather a test designed to make them feel happy after taking it. This is one of the reasons it's persisted for so many years in the corporate world after being disregarded by psychologists. [Vox.com](https://www.vox.com/2014/7/15/5881947/myers-briggs-personality-test-meaningless)

> Until we test them scientifically, we can’t tell the difference between that and pseudoscience like astrology. [Scientific American](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-accurate-are-personality-tests/)

> Interestingly, more recent research shows that 90% of people want to make changes in their personalities. As people, we want to improve ourselves. But non-scientific theories like Briggs' can lead people to believe they literally can't change, because their "core" attributes or "type" is inflexible. Hence, type-based tests that create a label can also create a fixed mindset.

> Because of their widespread use by employers and HR departments, personality tests have colonized and commodified the individual psyche.

# What is Empathy?

##  the ability to be aware of, understanding of, and sensitive to another
## person’s feelings and thoughts without having had 
## the same experience. [ref](https://5a5f89b8e10a225a44ac-ccbed124c38c4f7a3066210c073e7d55.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/files/pdfs/news/Empathy_on_the_Edge.pdf)

# Understanding our need space

__Statistics:__ This field would say that you need to take a _random_ sample of the group you wish to understand.   
__Data Science:__ Measure everything we can about people (track phones, purchases, friends, etc.) and use models to predict them.   
__Business:__ Build a survey and send it to your customers.   
__Empathetic Interviewing:__ Seek the extremes of the population and genuinely talk to them.   

> In our fieldwork we look for diverse people and situations to promote empathy, which we internally refer to as “extremes.” These mostly ordinary people with extreme points of view—owing to their personality, circumstances, or culture—provide a broad range of experiences and well-developed perspectives that would be harder to identify if we looked at a random sample of individuals representing a range of the target demographics. [ref](https://5a5f89b8e10a225a44ac-ccbed124c38c4f7a3066210c073e7d55.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/files/pdfs/news/Empathy_on_the_Edge.pdf)

# Hearing stories through interviews

> Remember, you’re not trying to solve problems here; you’re just looking for the needs, driven by what users say or do, and by what users think or feel.

> Empathizing with the people you’re designing for is the best route to truly grasping the context and complexities
of their lives. But most importantly, it keeps the people you’re designing for squarely grounded in the center of your work.

# Create Personas

> Personas are fictional characters, which you create based upon your research in order to represent the different user types that might use your service, product, site, or brand in a similar way. Creating personas helps the designer to understand users’ needs, experiences, behaviors, and goals.
