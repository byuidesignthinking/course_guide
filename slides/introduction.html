# Learning Empathy, Persuasion, and Emotional Intelligence

- Building mindsets is more than getting a grade
- Becoming is more than taking a class
- We get the chance to develop the core employable skills of the future

# Lifestyles, Grades, and Design Thinking

# On Grades

> The central argument here is that by acting as if grading motivates learning, we put both student and faculty energies in the wrong places. Does grading represent learning? Maybe … but mostly, grading motivates getting grades.

# On Education

> Anthropologists have reported that the hunter-gatherer groups they studied did not distinguish between work and play–essentially all of life was understood as play.
>
> With the rise of schooling, people began to think of learning as children’s work. The same power-assertive methods that had been used to make children work in fields and factories were quite naturally transferred to the classroom.
> 
> If children learn nothing else in school, they learn the difference between work and play and that learning is work, not play.

# On Job skills

> By 2020, more than a __third of the desired core skill sets__ of most occupations will be comprised of skills that are not yet considered crucial to the job today, according to our respondents. Overall, social skills such as __persuasion, emotional intelligence and teaching others__ will be in higher demand across industries than narrow technical skills, such as programming or equipment operation and control. _In essence, technical skills will need to be supplemented with strong social and collaboration skills._
