???

Highlight how you felt watching the Respect movie on Aretha when their group begins hear each other and play music that moves.  Great music feeds off of great musicians that understand what moves people.

# On Grades

> The central argument here is that by acting as if grading motivates learning, we put both student and faculty energies in the wrong places. Does grading represent learning? Maybe … but mostly, grading motivates getting grades.

# On Education

> Anthropologists have reported that the hunter-gatherer groups they studied did not distinguish between work and play–essentially all of life was understood as play.
>
> With the rise of schooling, people began to think of learning as children’s work. The same power-assertive methods that had been used to make children work in fields and factories were quite naturally transferred to the classroom.
> 
> If children learn nothing else in school, they learn the difference between work and play and that learning is work, not play.

# On Job skills

By 2020, more than a __third of the desired core skill sets__ of most occupations will be comprised of skills that are not yet considered crucial to the job today, according to our respondents. Overall, social skills such as __persuasion, emotional intelligence and teaching others__ will be in higher demand across industries than narrow technical skills, such as programming or equipment operation and control. _In essence, technical skills will need to be supplemented with strong social and collaboration skills._
