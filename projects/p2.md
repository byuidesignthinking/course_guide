# Game On

__Create a cost efficient physical game that teaches soft skills ...__

Notice that this design challenge is more clearly specified than the last challenge.  In fact we are setting the walls or boundaries within which your teams can create.  Let's look at each of the walls

## Physical Game

We don't want a **video game**.  The game should have cards, boards, tokens, and/or dice.  

## Cost Efficient

We are asking you to figure out a few elements.

> - What is the size of the audience you will market? 
> - What it will cost to build 1,000 units of your game?
> - What profit margin will you need to stay active in selling the product?
> - How much do you expect people to pay for the type of game you have built?
