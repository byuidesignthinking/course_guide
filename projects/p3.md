# Tackling big problems

> Create a low-cost program to combat homelessness

## What is homelessness?

- __Chronic:__ Those who are homeless for a more extended amount of time, usually older or injured people. The least common type of homelessness.
    
- __Transitional:__ People who stay at the shelter for only a short period due to a catastrophic event, usually younger people, who are forced to go to a homeless shelter for a short time. This is the most common type of homelessness.
    
- __Episodic:__ _Those who are frequently going in and out of homelessness, usually younger, and due to abuse, unemployment, and experience mental illness or medical problems.*

## Homelessness is expensive

> **So a simple problem — such as a car repair — that a higher-income person can eliminate with a credit card in five minutes can wipe out people living in poverty and put them on the streets or, worse, keep them there. It is much harder to climb out of poverty than it is to fall into it.**

## What empathy?

> **I can tell you right now there is NO solution to the homeless problem. People who are homeless it’s because they WANT to be. In NYC there are 10's of thousands of low-income housing, there are 100's of job placement and job training centers. Rehab, shelter, food banks, etc. Any possible help program you can imagine we got it. The problem is many people don’t want to work, they just want to hang out and get high. For the people that are homeless but don’t want to be, they get in these programs and guess what... they get jobs and are given housing. So next time you see a guy out begging for money, don’t give him any, you’re just enabling him to stay homeless.**
