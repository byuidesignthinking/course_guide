# Learning and Education

> Learning workforce skills through the incorporation of novel class structure ideas beyond the traditional classroom

The course structure includes things like;

- how grades are awarded
- what types of assessments are used
- how learning new material happens
- how students interact with each other in the class
- how the teacher delivers material
- how textbooks are used
- tools that are used in the course
- etc.

## Job Specific Vs. Job General Skills

### Technical Skills

The topics in the course around the specific major (e.g. Stat methods for statistics majors, biology principles for biology majors) don’t need to be discussed - only as they might relate to what you discover from the employer interviews.

### General Skills

What are the things that employers want students to have in their skills bag that school isn’t providing?

## Other thoughts

- You could pick one degree to help your team focus.
- You could think about elements of the course that promote enduring career learning.
- You could have different sets of materials that are incorporated into multiple classes as compared to having one class.
